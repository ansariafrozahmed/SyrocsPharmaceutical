          Beware of counterfeit products trading of the valuable goodwill of the
          Syrocs® brand. Like many companies that have expended years and
          enormous resources in carefully developing brand recognition, Syrocs
          products are being unlawfully imitated and sold at inferior quality
          through unauthorized channels, and usually at drastically reduced
          prices. These inferior Knockoffs are not easy to detect. Accordingly,
          these products do not meet Syrocs Group’s quality standards.
          <br />
          <br />
          The only way to ensure that you are purchasing genuine Syrocs products
          with assurance by Syrocs Group, is to purchase through an authorized
          retailer. Please report any suspect products to Customer Service at
          info@syrocs-pharmaceuticals.com or support@syrocs-pharmaceuticals.com.
          <br />
          <br />
          We intend to vigorously investigate those who manufacture or sell
          counterfeit Syrocs® products and take action against counterfeiters as
          appropriate to protect the value that the Syrocs Pharma® brand has
          come to represent. If you have any questions concerning this issue,
          please contact Customer Service. We appreciate your help in
          maintaining the integrity of the Syrocs brand. Beware of Bulk Packaged
          Products Sold as New
          <br />
          <br />
          Syrocs Group never sells old line-packaged products. All new Syrocs
          brand products are sold in individual, factory-sealed packages. Any
          product advertised as “genuine” but in “OLD” packaging is either used
          or counterfeit and should be treated as suspect.
